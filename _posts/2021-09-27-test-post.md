title: Visualization For Peguins Dataset
---

In this post, we are going to construct an interesting visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.

First, we can read the data into Python by running:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Then, we create the scatterplot by running:

```python
fgrid = sns.relplot(x = "Culmen Length (mm)", 
                    y = "Culmen Depth (mm)", 
                    hue = "Species", 
                    data = penguins,
                    palette=["b", "r", "g"]).set(title=
                          'Figure 1: Culmen Length vs Culmen Depth by Species')
```
