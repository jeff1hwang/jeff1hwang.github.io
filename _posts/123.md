title: Blog Post 0 - Visualization For Peguins Dataset
---

In this post, we are going to construct an interesting visualization of the [Palmer Penguins data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv).

# Imports
First, we load the packages we may use in this post.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

# Pre-Processing & Data Cleanning
Then, we get the penguin data. We are using the data from palmer_penguins.csv which contains observations of penguin features from various studies. We have 344 penguins, with 17 features each (including some NaNs).

```python
url = 'https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv'
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
#checking first 5 rows of our data  
print(penguins.shape)     
penguins.head()
```

**Analysis:** This scatterplot shows the correlation of Culmen Length and Culmen depth by species. Culmen length and Culmen Depth are positively correlated within each species. These features may be useful because there are three distinct clusters by species. Gentoo has the least culmen depth, Adelie has the least culmen length, and Chinstrap has the greatest culmen length and depth.
