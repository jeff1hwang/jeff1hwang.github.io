title: Visualization For Peguins Dataset
---

In this post, we are going to construct an interesting visualization of the [Palmer Penguins data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv).

## Read the Data
First, we can read the data into Python by running:

```python
# import required packages
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
# Read the data set
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
## Create the Scatterplot
Then, we create the scatterplot by running:

```python
# Create the scatterplot by using following code
fgrid = sns.relplot(x = "Culmen Length (mm)", 
                    y = "Culmen Depth (mm)", 
                    hue = "Species", 
                    data = penguins,
                    palette=["b", "r", "g"]).set(title=
                          'Figure 1: Culmen Length vs Culmen Depth by Species')
```

**Analysis:** This scatterplot shows the correlation of Culmen Length and Culmen depth by species. Culmen length and Culmen Depth are positively correlated within each species. These features may be useful because there are three distinct clusters by species. Gentoo has the least culmen depth, Adelie has the least culmen length, and Chinstrap has the greatest culmen length and depth.
